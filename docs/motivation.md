This document discuss the reasons and our motivation behind developing this software.

### Motivation
All the members behind developing this software have recently joined the NC State University and new to the US education system. 
The NC State provides each student with a lot of resouces and at times guiding our way through this is a bit difficult espacially for new international student.
The Wolfware-Moodle page is the only site having details of the courses taken by a student. There is a lot of information scattered in that page.
One can find everything from course syllabus, study material, exam schedules, discussion groups, formus and much more. 
Because of this students waste thier valueable time in finding a particular resource in that site which could be better used to do other productive tasks.
At times faculty uses other platforms like Github, Piazza and Gradiance which helps them better connect with students.
As fellow students we understand the pain in find a particular file or certain doubt posted weeks ago and thus we deliver a solution which is essentaily a better version of Moodle in certain aspects.
The main aim behind building this project is we wanted to help faculty and students by providing a software which helps them easily connect and save a lot of valuable time.
We have created a seperate system to keep track of all the complaints and doubts asked by a particular class to the respective class faculty.
This save time and helps students better organise their doubts and similar faculty can have a record of what all complaints and doubts students have asked.
