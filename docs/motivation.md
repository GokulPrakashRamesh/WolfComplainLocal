This document discusses the reasons and our motivation behind developing this software.

### Motivation
All the members behind developing this software have recently joined the NC State University and new to the US education system. 
The NC State provides each student with a lot of resources and at times guiding our way through this is a bit difficult especially for new international student.
The Wolfware-Moodle page is the only site having details of the courses taken by a student. There is a lot of information scattered in that page.
One can find everything from course syllabus, study material, exam schedules, discussion groups, forums and much more. 
Because of this studentâ€™s waste their valuable time in finding a particular resource in that site which could be better used to do other productive tasks.
At times faculty uses other platforms like GitHub, Discord, Piazza and Gradience which helps them better connect with students.
As fellow students we understand the pain in find a particular file or certain doubt posted weeks ago and thus we deliver a solution which is essentially a better version of Moodle in certain aspects.
The main aim behind building this project is we wanted to help faculty and students by providing a software which helps them easily connect and save a lot of valuable time.

### Shortcomings of current system
Moodle consist of many functionalities and is not specialised for doubt solving.
The forums in Moodle are not user-friendly also a single course page could have multiple forums.
Thus faculty has to rely on different software for doubt solving and discussion forums.
As different faculty use different software for doubt solving, there no single place to access all the doubts a student has asked.
Also student will need time to get familiarised with these different doubt solving platforms.
As a result, the initial time duration is wasted on getting acquainted with the new software and more time is wasted in finding a particular feature of that software. 


### What we bring to table
We have created a separate system to keep track of all the complaints and doubts asked by a particular class to the respective class faculty.
This will help students save time and better organise their doubts and similarly faculty can have a record of what all complaints and doubts students have asked.
This way the number of same doubts asked repeatedly will decrease also students will easily find solutions to their doubts.
